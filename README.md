# Nearest-Prime-Number
A code that gives you the nearest prime number to the number that you entered

For example
Input = 3
Output = 3 
Input = 4
Output = 3 and 5
Input = 8
Output = 7
Input = 10
Output = 11

And I just want to clearify that my codes aren't anything special I just upload them for fun and I use github as a cloud for my codes to never lose them :) HAVE A NÄ°CE DAY
